                <h1 class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-title align-left pb-3 display-2">It's Very Important!</h1>
                <h1 class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-text align-left display-7">I'm not completely sure why it comes as a surprise, but it does. People are shocked that their WordPress websites require so much maintenance. Some of these people are business owners, who happen to be hosting their own WordPress websites. Some of these people are developers who are unfamiliar with the popular Content Mangament System, whose platform now powers over 25% of the web.<br><br>Whatever the case may be, these people are often times shocked and overwhelmed once they've realized just how hefty of a responsibility running a WordPress website really is.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, WordPress is absolutely great. But it does have its drawbacks - a major one being its need for frequent updates. Another one being plugin incompatability. And did I mention the risk of running out of PHP memory? Yeah, WordPress... fun stuff....<br><br>So what's my point? If you're a WordPress beginner, then you are likely going to run into one of the aforementioned issues. And if you're a business owner, operating your own WordPress website, these are issues that you're going to want to avoid.</h1>

                <h1 class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-title align-left pb-3 display-2">Is It Really That Big of a Deal?</h1>
                <h1 class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-text align-left display-7">Yes! Yes, it is! I just spent the better part of 12 hours, servicing a WordPress website that hadn't seen maintenance in over two years. My issue isn't with the amount of time that it took for me to complete the project. Sure, what was supposed to be a small update, quickly evolved into a nightmare inducing, category five crisis that resulted in my sever lack of sleep today. But that's not the problem.<br><br>My concern is how that category five crisis could have impacted my clients business. Because what could have happened to my clients website, would have been enough to put them out of business.<br><br>So where should I start? Perhaps with the security risks? Or maybe I should talk about the likelihood of getting a vague server error because your website is bogged down with old files.... I could go on and on.<br></h1>

                <h1 class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-title align-left pb-3 display-2">So, What Should You Do?</h1>
                <h1 class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-text align-left display-7">Update your WordPress website reguarly. Create and maintain a back-up file of your website, so that in the event of a catastrophe, at least you're covered. Do this at least once a week, preferably multiple times a week.<br><br>Throughout the week, login to your website via your WordPress Admin panel and check for any update notifications. Make sure that you are running the latest versions of WordPress, your theme(s), and any plugins that you are using. If you're not, update them A.S.A.P. If you don't have the time to make these changes, or simply don't know how, then hire a professional who can.<br><br>For security purposes alone, it is imperative that you keep your site up to date. Because when you don't, hackers are able to exploit known vulnarabilities within your websites files. If a plugin that you are running no longer has developer support (no new updates, untested with current versions of WordPress, etc), it may also be vulnerable to security issues.<br><br>I won't bother going in to the many other reasons for why you should keep a healthy, living, breathing, constantly updating site (especially if you are using WordPress). Instead I shall save that tirade for another day. But I will say this... if you want to rank well in search engines, if you want to stay compliant with modern web standards, and if you'd like to keep your website secure, then make sure that you update your website.</h1>
